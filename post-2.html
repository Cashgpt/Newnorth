    <p>For millennia, Indigenous peoples across Canada have stewarded forests through profound ecological understanding, sustainable harvesting practices, and regenerative land management strategies. As Canada embarks on historic reforestation initiatives, true success requires embracing this knowledge — not sidelining it.</p>

    <h2>Beyond Consultation: Toward Genuine Partnership</h2>
    <p>Too often, Indigenous engagement in reforestation projects has been treated as a checkbox. Real restoration demands more. It requires genuine partnership, decision-making power, knowledge sharing, and equitable economic participation at every stage — from seed sourcing to long-term forest stewardship.</p>

    <h2>The Ecological and Strategic Advantage</h2>
    <p>Scientific studies increasingly affirm that Indigenous-managed lands outperform protected areas in biodiversity, ecosystem resilience, and long-term sustainability. Integrating Indigenous leadership into reforestation projects enhances outcomes — not just socially, but ecologically and economically.</p>

    <h2>Sylvan North's Commitment</h2>
    <p>At Sylvan North Forestry, we recognize that Indigenous partnership is not just a moral imperative — it is a strategic advantage for scalable, lasting success. We are committed to building partnerships based on mutual respect, knowledge exchange, and shared stewardship of the forests we aim to regenerate.</p>

    <p>The future of sustainable forestry in Canada must be Indigenous-led, innovation-supported, and community-empowered. Sylvan North is proud to walk that path together.</p>
